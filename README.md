# Movie Media

A web application using the OMDb API that allows users to share comments about movies. (HTML / CSS / Bootstrap / Javascript / jQuery / Node.js / MongoDB)

## Features

* Infinite scrolling while displaying the results of the search.
* Access to comments related to the movie that is being presented.
* When logged in, the user can write comments up to 1000 characters about any movie.
* Also when logged in, the user can add a movie to his/her list of "watched" or "want to watch".
* A profile page where you can find the user information, as well as a list of the movies in two categories: "Watched" and "Want to watch".
* Access to the IMDb link for all movies.

## To do:

There are still some changes that need to be done:

* Review routes.
* Insert flash messages.
* Handle errors better.
* Improve css file.
* Deploy it.

Some functionalities that I would like to add in the future:

* Mark a comment as helpful or not helpful (like / dislike).
